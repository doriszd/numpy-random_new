    "   NumPy is a library for the Python programing language. It is intrinsically integrated with Python (en.wikipedia.org). It is a successor for two earlier scientific libraries, Numeric code and Numarray.https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/index.html As NumPy, its initial release was in 2006. The primary creator of NumPy is American data scientist and businessman, Travis Oliphant. NumPy is a distributed, volunteer, open-source project, and everyone is welcome to give their contribution. \n",
    "Some of the features that NumPy contains are powerful N-dimensional array objects, sophisticated functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code and many others. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/about.html\n",
