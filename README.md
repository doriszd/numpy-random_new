# Installing NumPy library

In most use cases the best way to install NumPy on your system is by using a pre-built package for your operating system. Please see https://scipy.org/install.html for links to available options.



# Running Jupyter notebook 


1. Enter the startup folder by typing cd /folder_name .
2. Run jupyter notebook command to launch the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab.
3. In the top right corner press New, Python 3 to open new file in jupyter
4. Click ESC and key shortcut m to markdown or double click the text in the cell if you want to edit. 
5. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
6. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
7. Closing the browser (or the tab) will not close the Jupyter Notebook App. To completely shut it down you need to close the associated terminal.


# Downloading the repository 

1. Go to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of the repository: https://github.com/doriszd/numpy-random_new
3. Under the repository name, click Clone or download
4. Save the repository to a local folder location on your computer.
5. Navigate to your target directory in the command line


# About Numpy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a linear algebra library in Python. It is a very important library on which almost every data science or machine learning Python packages such as SciPy (Scientific Python), Mat−plotlib (plotting library), Scikit-learn, etc depends on to a reasonable extent.
NumPy is very useful for performing mathematical and logical operations on Arrays. It provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python.


# About Assignment

The aim of this assignment is to: 

1. Explain the overall purpose of the Numpy package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least ﬁve “Distributions” functions. 
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
