    "Random numbers have been used for many thousands of years. Whether we talk about flipping a coin or rolling a dice, the goal is to leave the end result up to random chance. It is the same case with random number generators in a computer. The aim is to achieve an unpredictable, random result that could not be guessed. Computers generate random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling. There are two categories of random numbers, “true” random numbers and pseudorandom numbers. Its difference is important for the security of encryption systems. To generate a “true” random number, the computer measures some type of physical phenomenon that takes place outside of the computer. For example the computer could rely on atmospheric noise or simply use the exact time you press keys on your keyboard as a source of unpredictable data (www.howtogeek.com). This type of random numbers is mostly used in programs in which data security is main priority. In this work we are going to focus more on pseudorandom numbers as they are a sample of numbers that look close to true random numbers but were generated using some deterministic process (machinelearningmastery.com).  Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) refer to an algorithm that uses mathematical formulas to produce sequences of random numbers (www.geeksforgeeks.org). One of the ways to generate random numbers is by using NumPy random numbers package. For that purpose, NumPy provides various routines that use particular algorithm to generate pseudorandom numbers.In order to dive in it into more details, in the next few paragraphs I will be focusing more on NumPy library and its features. \n"

    "  NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programing language. It is intrinsically integrated with Python (en.wikipedia.org). It is a successor for two earlier scientific libraries, Numeric code and Numarray.https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/index.html As NumPy, its initial release was in 2006. The primary creator of NumPy is American data scientist and businessman, Travis Oliphant. NumPy is a distributed, volunteer, open-source project, and everyone is welcome to give their contribution. \n",
    "Some of the features that NumPy contains are powerful N-dimensional array objects, sophisticated functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code and many others. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/about.html\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance. There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation while Python lists can grow dynamically. Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original. There are some NumPy’s benefits over Python lists, which include: being more compact, faster access in reading and writing items, being more convenient and more efficient (https://towardsdatascience.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to efficiently use most of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient, it is also crucial to know how to use NumPy arrays (https://numpy.org).\n",

    "- vectorized code is easier and more concise to read\n",
    "\n",
    "- fewer lines of code generally means fewer bugs\n",
    "\n",
